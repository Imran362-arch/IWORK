The proteasome recognizes ubiquitinated proteins and uses ATP energy to drive the proteins through its tubular structure, degrading them into small peptides; attachment of 4 or more ubiquitin monomers is typically required before <strong>proteasomal degradation</strong> can take place.  Ubiquitination plays a role in many cell functions requiring the breakdown of specific proteins, including antigen processing, muscle wasting, cell cycle regulation, and disposal of <strong>misfolded proteins</strong>.</p><p><strong>Impairment</strong> of the ubiquitin-proteasome system can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease).  Failure to properly degrade abnormal proteins can cause <strong>aggregation</strong> of misfolded proteins and eventual obstruction of intracellular molecular traffic, leading to cell death.  Mutations in genes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (eg, <em>Parkin</em>, <em>PINK1</em>, and <em>DJ-1</em>) are associated with autosomal recessive forms of <strong>Parkinson disease</strong> that have an early age of onset (age &lt;50).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>  Heterochromatin refers to condensed DNA that has a low level of transcriptional activity, whereas euchromatin (loosely arranged) has high levels of transcriptional activity.  Histone acetylation promotes the formation of euchromatin; this process is impaired in Huntington disease, but is unrelated to the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>  Vitamin K–dependent gamma-carboxylation is critical for the functioning of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X and of anticoagulative proteins C and S.  Warfarin inhibits reduction of vitamin K to its active form, which in turn prevents carboxylation of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>  One step in the hepatic processing of bilirubin includes bilirubin conjugation with glucuronic acid in the endoplasmic reticulum.  Patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome lack the enzyme needed to catalyze bilirubin glucuronidation, causing severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>  Phosphorylation, or the addition of a phosphate group (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup>) to a protein or other organic molecule, is commonly involved in the regulation of enzymatic activity.  Hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins can contribute to abnormal protein aggregation in Alzheimer disease, not Parkinson disease.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Ubiquitin is a protein that undergoes attachment to other proteins, labeling them for degradation by proteasomes.

Ras proteins exist in 2 different states: an <strong>inactive GDP-bound state</strong> and an <strong>active GTP-bound state</strong>.  Ras becomes activated when a growth factor ligand binds to a <strong>receptor tyrosine kinase</strong> located on the cell membrane, causing autophosphorylation of the receptor.  This triggers binding of adaptor proteins that interact with Ras, promoting GDP removal and GTP binding.  Activated Ras then begins a phosphorylation cascade that results in the activation of <strong>mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)</strong>, which enters the nucleus to influence gene transcription.</p><p>Ras proteins have intrinsic GTPase activity that allows them to hydrolyze GTP; this mechanism prevents accumulation of active Ras (GTP-bound) in the absence of hormonal signaling.  <em>RAS</em> gene mutations can lead to decreased intrinsic GTPase activity; this results in a constitutively activated Ras protein that causes constant and unregulated cell proliferation.  <em>RAS</em> mutations are commonly identified in cancerous tumors, specifically colorectal and pancreatic malignancies.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and C)</strong>  ATP serves as a phosphate source for kinase-dependent phosphorylation reactions involved in numerous intracellular signaling pathways.

An error can occur at any stage. <strong>Inclusion cell (I-cell) disease</strong> is a defect in posttranslational modification in the Golgi body. Normally, proteins designated for lysosomes are tagged with mannose-6-phosphate. However, in I-cell disease, a defect in a phosphotransferase enzyme prevents phosphorylation of mannose. <strong>Lysosomal acid hydrolases</strong> are therefore transported inappropriately to the extracellular space, causing an increase in serum concentration and a decrease in intracellular concentration, as seen in this patient. Without acid hydrolases to degrade cellular debris within lysosomes, the waste products accumulate and form inclusion bodies. I-cell disease presents in infancy with features similar to Hurler syndrome, including skeletal abnormalities, developmental delay, cloudy corneas, and recurrent respiratory infections. I-cell disease is generally fatal in childhood.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong> DNA methylation silences gene transcription so that the affected protein would be completely absent. <strong>(Choice C)</strong> A defect in protein folding, as seen with the CFTR protein in cystic fibrosis, would result in abnormal protein functioning. Protein concentration may be normal or low due to more rapid degradation. <strong>(Choices D and E)</strong> Splicing mutations can result in inappropriate removal of exons or persistence of introns; this creates aberrant mRNA that is presented for translation and results in production of an abnormal protein. Similarly, a defect in translation results in insufficient or abnormal protein synthesis, which is reflected both in the serum and intracellularly.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong> Posttranslational modification of proteins is important for targeting proteins to the correct location.

Upper endoscopy is performed and the bone is successfully removed.  However, the patient is incidentally found to have mild hypercalcemia on laboratory testing.  On follow-up with his primary care provider 2 weeks later, he has no symptoms and clinical examination is unremarkable.  Further questioning reveals that several of his family members also have mild hypercalcemia.  Subsequent laboratory studies show a borderline high parathyroid hormone concentration, very low urinary calcium level, and normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level.  A mutation in which of the following receptors is most likely responsible for this patient's laboratory abnormalities?</p>",
